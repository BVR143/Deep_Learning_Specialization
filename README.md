## Object Detection 

Let us apply our knowlegde of Convolutional Neural Network to one of the hottest ( Most Challenging ) field of `Computer Vision`. `Object Detection` is one of the areas of computer vision that is working so better nowadays. In order to build up to object detection , first we have to learn the concept of `Localization`
